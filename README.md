This needs a data folder with the following dataset unpacked:
$kaggle datasets download -d oddrationale/mnist-in-csv

This will give a training and a test data set as .csv files for the 28x28 "photos" of labeled hand-drawn digits.
THESE FILES ARE TOO BIG FOR GITHUB - *just* over 100MB for the training.
